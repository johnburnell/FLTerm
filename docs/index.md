## Introduction

tinyTerm started as a simple telnet client used to work with telecom transport equipment through command line interface(TL1). Over time  it has grown to a full function terminal emulator supporting serial, telnet, ssh, sftp and netconf connections with xterm emulation,  plus unique features like: **command autocompletion**, **scp integration**, **batch automation**, and **scripting**.

tinyTerm is written in C with Win32 API, [libssh2](http://libssh2.org) used for SSH2 functions.

Windows 10 user should install from Microsoft Store, users on older versions of Windows, or prefer portable apps download exe files.

## Usage notes

> ### Terminal Emulation
> Each time a connection is made using the connect dialog, an entry will be added to the Term menu, simply select the menu entry to make the same connection again. 
> 
> For serial connections, available serial ports will be auto detected and added to the ports dropdown list in connection dialog.
> 
> for netconf connections, typing netconf messages is possible but not really practical, it's better to use a text or xml editor to compose the messages and then drag&drop to the terminal window. 
> 
> Press left mouse button and drag to select text, selected text are copied to clipboard when left button is released. Double click to select and copy the whole word under mouse pointer. Right click to paste text from clipboard
>
> Scroll back buffer holds 8000 lines of text, the "Save all" function from Term menu allows user to save the whole buffer to a file. Use pageup key or mouse wheel to scroll back, scrollbar will appear when pageup is pressed, and will hide when scrolled all the way down. 
> ### Command Autocompletion
> When local edit mode is enabled, key presses are not sent to remote host until "Enter" key is pressed, and the input is auto completed using command history, every command typed in local edit mode is added to command history to complete future inputs. Command history is saved to tinyTerm.hist at exit, then loaded into memory at the next start of tinyTerm. 
> 
> Command history file is saved as %USERPROFILE%\documents\tinyTerm\tinyTerm.hist by default, copy tinyTerm.hist to the same folder as tinyTerm.exe for portable use. Since the command history file is just a plain text file, user can edit the file outside of tinyTerm to put additional commands in the list for command auto-completion. For example put all command TL1 commands in the history list to use as a dictionary.
> 
> ### Batch Automation
> To automate the execution of commands, simply drag and drop a list of commands from text editor, or select "Run..." from Script menu and select a text file with all the commands to be executed, tinyTerm send one command at a time, wait for prompt string before sending the next command, to avoid overflowing the receive buffer of the remote host or network device. 
> 
> Most command line interface system uses a prompt string to tell user it’s ready for the next command, for example "> " or "$ " used by Cisco routers. tinyTerm will auto detect the prompt string used by remote host when user is typing commands interactively, and use the detected prompt string during scripting. Additionally, prompt string can be set in the script using special command "!Prompt {str}", refer to appendix A for details and other special commands supported for scripting. 
> 
> ### SCP integration
> When a SSH or SFTP session is established in tinyTerm, simply drag and drop files to the terminal window will cause those files to be transfered to remote host using SCP or SFTP put, remote files will be created in the current directory. 
> 
> To copy file from server to a local folder, select the filename in the terminal window, then chose "scp_to_folder.js" from script menu.
> 
> ### FTPd/TFTPd/HTTPd
> A built in FTP server can be used for simple file transfer tasks, like software download to network devices. Only one user name "tiny" is allowed to login, with password "term". For security, user session to the FTP server is timed out in 1 minute without action, and FTP server will time out in 15 minutes without active connection.
> 
> Similarly a built in TFTP server can be used for file transfer with simpler devices like cable modems. TFTP server times out after 5 minutes. 
> 
> A built in HTTP server is started as soon as tinyTerm is started, for the first instance of tinyTerm running, HTTPd listens at 127.0.0.1:8080, the second instance listens at 127.0.0.1:8081, the third instance listens at 127.0.0.1:8082, so on and so forth. Since it's listening on 127.0.0.1 only, the HTTPd will only accept connections from local machine, for the purpose of scripting.

## Scripting interface

The Built in HTTP server will accept GET request from local machine, which means any program running on the same machine, be it a browser or a javascript or any other script, can connect to tinyTerm and request either a file or the result of a command, 

for example:

	- http://127.0.0.1:8080/tinyTerm.html	return tinyTerm.html from current working folder
	- http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ls%20-al	return the result of "ls -al" from remote host
	- http://127.0.0.1:8080/?!Selection 	return current selected text from scroll back buffer
	
Notice the "!" just before "Selection" in the last example, when a command is started with "!", it's being executed by tinyTerm instead of sent to remote host, There are about 30 tinyTerm commands supported for the purpose of making connections, setting options, sending commands, scp files, turning up ssh2 tunnels, see appendix for the list.

The script scp_to_folder.js referenced in the trailer, is a perfect example of scripting tinyTerm

```js
// Javascript to download a highlighted file via scp.
var xml = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
var port = "8080/?";
if ( WScript.Arguments.length>0 ) port = WScript.Arguments(0)+"/?";
var filename = term("!Selection");
var objShell = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application")
var objFolder = objShell.BrowseForFolder(0, "Destination", 0x11, "")
if ( objFolder ) term("!scp :"+filename+" "+objFolder.Self.path);

function term( cmd )
{
   xml.Open ("GET", "http://127.0.0.1:"+port+cmd, false);
   xml.Send();
   return xml.responseText;
}
```
